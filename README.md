# Discrete Mathematics

## About This Course
This course taught me how to model and solve real-world problems using discrete structures. Through programming exercises in Python, I explored graph theory, probability, and algorithm design.

## Practical Work

### Seminar 1: Probability
I implemented probability simulations for test exams:
- Calculated probabilities of passing when guessing answers
- Built a Monte Carlo simulator running 100,000 test cases
- Extended it to handle partial knowledge (discarding wrong options)

### Seminar 2: Graph Fundamentals
I modeled social networks as graphs:
- Created WhatsApp-style mutual friendship graphs (undirected)
- Implemented Instagram-style follower graphs (directed)
- Programmed the Havel-Hakimi algorithm to validate degree sequences

### Seminar 3: Graph Traversal
I simulated early web crawling:
- Built a graph representing linked webpages
- Implemented BFS and DFS to "discover" the entire graph
- Compared traversal orders between algorithms

### Seminar 4: Optimal Paths
I solved pathfinding problems in Westeros:
- Added edge weights to graph structures
- Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to escape Winterfell
- Extended it to reconstruct optimal escape routes
- Optional: Created a Floyd-Warshall distance matrix

### Seminar 5: Eulerian & Hamiltonian Paths
I planned messenger routes in Middle-earth:
- Manually verified Eulerian circuit conditions
- Implemented Hierholzer's algorithm
- Analyzed Hamiltonian paths with blocked routes
